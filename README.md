HappinessScore 2015- 2019
An analysis of the World Happiness Report 2015 to 2019. The report has become an indispensable resource for satisfying the growing global interest in prioritizing happiness -- or well-being -- in government policymaking. 
The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations, and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.
Using Python for analysis and Tableau for some visualizations, I performed an exploratory analysis to derive insights and draw conclusions.

Procedures explored during the project:
- Python
- Exploratory analysis (visualizations)
- Geospatial analysis (shapefile)
- Regression analysis
- Cluster analysis
- Time-series analysis
- Analysis narrative
